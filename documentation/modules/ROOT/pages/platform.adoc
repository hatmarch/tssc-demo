== Secure Software Factory Platform

. Log into the OpenShift platform with a cluster admin and open two tabs (or windows):
+
[tabs]
====
Admin Perspective::
+
--
Open the *Admin Perspective* of the dashboard (possibly initialized to the `devsecops` project):

--
Developer Perspective (Topology View)::
+
--
[#topologyview]
Open the *Topology View* of the `devsecops` project, as seen here:

====

. Switch to the `devsecops` project and click on OperatorHub
. Scroll down to provider type and check `Red Hat NAPS Community Operators`.  Type `software factory` to attract focus on the Ploigos operator
** Explain that OpenShift allows administers to subscribe to different channels (even their own trusted internal channels) for available operators
** This represents Red Hat consulting's catalog of trusted operators

. Next let's take a look at the (pre) installed Software Factory Operator in more detail.  Click on the `Installed Operators` button in the left navbar.  Click on the Ploigos Software Factory Operator
+

+
. Scroll through the Operator Details page and double check that the operator is successfully installed.  
. Point out the two different CustomResources that the operator watches for, namely the `TsscPipeline` and `TsscPlatform` CRs.  
. Select the `TsscPlatform` CR to create the platform for our secure software factory.  Click the `Create TsscPlatform` button

. Switch to the YAML view and briefly show the different configuration options for the platform and then click `Create`
+

+
. As soon as you hit create, switch to the second tab/window <<topologyview,*Developer Perspective (Topology View)*>>
+
. Zoom out to show the operator doing its work to create the items in the platform.  Here's what it looks like in the middle of its run:

. Wait for the platform to be built out

[NOTE]
.Determining when the platform is completed
====
You can determine when the operator has completed successfully by running the following command in a hidden terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
(cd pass:[${DEMO_HOME}]/ansible; ansible localhost -m include_role -a name=ploigos_support -e ploigos_wait=true -e ploigos_install=false)
----

If it completes successfully you should see something like this:
[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "msg": "Platform has been successfully installed"
}
----
====
+
. When the platform has finished, refit the Topology View if you haven't already and zoom out to survey the different aspects of the platform
+

+
. When the platform has finished, return to the operator <<topologyview,*Admin Perspective*>> and show that the platform has indicated successful installation
+
image::tsscplatform-successful.png[]
+
. OPTIONAL: Click into the yaml view of the admin perspective and compare it to the topology view as indicated below:
